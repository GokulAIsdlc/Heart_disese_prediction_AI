Heart Disease Prediction using Bayesian Network

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using a Bayesian Network model. The system analyzes patient health data to determine the probability of heart disease, aiming to support early diagnosis and informed medical decisions.

Objectives

Develop a probabilistic model that captures relationships between various risk factors and heart disease.

Aid healthcare professionals in risk assessment.

Provide a framework for interpretable AI-based medical decision support.

Dataset

The project uses a structured dataset containing patient information and medical attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Resting blood pressure

Cholesterol level

Fasting blood sugar

Resting ECG results

Maximum heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression

Slope of the ST segment

Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

Thalassemia

The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing attributes.

Bayesian Network Construction: Defining the network structure and conditional probability tables.

Model Training: Fitting the Bayesian Network to the training data.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Outcomes

A predictive model capable of estimating the probability of heart disease for individual patients.

Interpretable results that show the influence of each attribute on the prediction.

Potential Applications

Early screening tool for patients at risk.

Decision support system for healthcare providers.

Educational resource for illustrating probabilistic reasoning in medical AI.
