# Heart Disease Prediction using Bayesian Network

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a **Bayesian Network** model.  
The system analyzes patient health data to calculate probabilities, supporting early diagnosis and medical decision-making.

## Objectives
- Develop a probabilistic model that captures relationships between various risk factors and heart disease.
- Aid healthcare professionals in risk assessment.
- Provide a framework for interpretable AI-based medical decision support.

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient information and medical attributes such as:

- **Age**  
- **Sex**  
- **Resting blood pressure**  
- **Cholesterol level**  
- **Fasting blood sugar**  
- **Resting ECG results**  
- **Maximum heart rate achieved**  
- **Exercise-induced angina**  
- **ST depression**  
- **Slope of the ST segment**  
- **Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy**  
- **Thalassemia**

**Target variable:** Presence or absence of heart disease.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean dataset, handle missing values, normalize attributes.  
2. **Bayesian Network Construction**: Define structure and conditional probability tables.  
3. **Model Training**: Fit the Bayesian Network to the training data.  
4. **Evaluation**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to measure performance.

## Outcomes
- Predictive model estimating the probability of heart disease for individuals.
- Interpretable outputs showing the influence of each attribute.

## Potential Applications
- Early screening tool for patients at risk.
- Decision support for healthcare providers.
- Educational resource for teaching probabilistic reasoning in medical AI.
